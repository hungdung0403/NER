Named entity recognition (NER) — sometimes referred to as entity chunking, extraction, or identification — is the task of identifying and categorizing key information (entities) in text. An entity can be any word or series of words that consistently refers to the same thing. Every detected entity is classified into a predetermined category. For example, an NER machine learning (ML) model might detect the word “super.AI” in a text and classify it as a “Company”.

NER is a form of natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence. NLP is concerned with computers processing and analyzing natural language, i.e., any language that has developed naturally, rather than artificially, such as with computer coding languages.

In this article, we use several machine learning and deep learning models toNER problem processing for CrossNER dataset with five fieldsin the data set. The results obtained on the Bi-LSTM models,Bi-Gru, Bi-LSTM + CNN, Bi-Gru + CNN, TF-XML-RoBERTa...
From there, make comments and evaluations for the dataset and the algorithm is used.
